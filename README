CStopwatch
==========

This is a quick and dirty utility class I wrote for the Windows platform. I
found myself needing to benchmark in many applications.

It has been a while since I have C++'d but I suspect it may be bad habit to have
the source mixed in the header file.

Anyway, I hope this is of use to someone.
